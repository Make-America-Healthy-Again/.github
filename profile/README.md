## RFK Jr. Defends Fast Food as ‘American Culture’ Following Trump Endorsement and McDonald's Shift  

In a political twist that has left many Americans both intrigued and puzzled, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. officially endorsed former President Donald Trump for the upcoming U.S. presidential election. What has stirred even more conversation is RFK Jr.'s defense of fast food—despite his own health initiatives aimed at curbing chronic diseases across the nation. His comments came just after Trump made a headline-grabbing stop at a McDonald's in Philadelphia, where he donned a hat, tried his hand at making French fries, and mingled with employees.  

Kennedy’s endorsement, along with his remarks on fast food, has sparked lively debate, with both supporters and critics weighing in on his health platform and vision for American culture.


### Fast Food as a Cultural Staple  

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Kennedy stated, “Fast food is part of American culture.” He went on to acknowledge that, although fast food is woven into the American lifestyle, it doesn’t have to be inherently unhealthy. Kennedy argued that the key to improving national health lies not in eliminating fast food but in changing how it is prepared. His most controversial suggestion? Bringing back beef tallow for frying.

Historically, McDonald’s and other fast-food chains fried their iconic French fries in beef tallow, a rendered form of animal fat. However, in 1990, they replaced beef tallow with seed oils under pressure from health advocates, who believed saturated animal fats were unhealthy. Kennedy highlighted that over the years, new research has pointed to the health risks associated with industrial seed oils. “Seed oils,” Kennedy said, “are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic. Interestingly, obesity rates began rising right around the time fast food restaurants replaced beef tallow with seed oils.”  

He continued, “Americans have every right to enjoy a burger and fries on a night out without unknowingly being poisoned by heavily subsidized seed oils. It’s time to *Make Frying Oil Tallow Again*.”


### Beef Tallow vs. Seed Oils: A Healthier Choice?  

Kennedy’s call to reintroduce beef tallow is not just nostalgic; it taps into the growing criticism around seed oils. Oils like canola, soybean, and corn are now widely used in fast food, but they are heavily processed and have been linked to chronic inflammation, weight gain, and heart disease. On the other hand, beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat, was once dismissed as unhealthy but is now experiencing a revival among nutritionists who argue it is more stable for cooking and less prone to oxidation.

Kennedy’s critique reflects a broader trend of consumers becoming more skeptical of processed oils and shifting toward traditional cooking fats like butter, lard, and tallow. Still, his suggestion that fast food chains return to beef tallow has been met with skepticism—both for practical reasons and cultural resistance.  

Many fast food chains argue that the switch to seed oils was necessary to meet changing health guidelines and accommodate plant-based diets. Reintroducing beef tallow would not only increase costs but also raise concerns about animal sourcing and sustainability.


### Memes and Public Reaction  

The political twist of RFK Jr. endorsing Trump—and then appearing to justify fast food as culturally significant—has inspired a flood of reactions online. Memes mocking Kennedy’s alignment with Trump have flooded X, with some posts poking fun at the seeming contradiction of the two promoting health initiatives while supporting fast food consumption.  

One viral post joked, “RFK Jr. promising to rid America of junk food, only for Trump to roll into McDonald's and start flipping fries in seed oil—how’s that *Make America Healthy Again* campaign going?”  

Despite the online mockery, Kennedy’s message resonates with a segment of the population that feels demonized for enjoying fast food. His argument appeals to a broader cultural narrative: Americans want healthier options but not at the expense of convenience or tradition.  



### What Does This Mean for American Health?  

RFK Jr.’s message underscores a growing tension in American health discussions—balancing public health initiatives with cultural traditions. On the one hand, fast food remains a beloved part of American life. On the other, the U.S. faces an epidemic of chronic diseases linked to diet, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.  

His endorsement of Trump, combined with his push for healthier fast food, suggests a shift in his approach—less about policing individual choices and more about reforming how food is prepared and served. It reflects the belief that people shouldn’t have to sacrifice enjoyment to eat healthily.  

Kennedy’s vision aligns with his broader philosophy: tackling chronic illness not by removing all indulgences but by promoting transparency and better food practices. His focus on beef tallow signals a desire to return to traditional cooking methods that, in his view, align better with human health.


### Conclusion  

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s surprising endorsement of Donald Trump and his defense of fast food reflect the complex intersection of politics, culture, and public health. By advocating for the return of beef tallow in fast food preparation, he taps into nostalgia while critiquing the current food landscape. His comments challenge Americans to rethink what healthy eating means—encouraging them to embrace both tradition and informed choices.  

While some dismiss his suggestions as impractical or contradictory, others see it as a call to reimagine how fast food fits into modern life. Whether or not fast food chains will heed his call to *Make Frying Oil Tallow Again* remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate about health, culture, and food will remain a central issue in the lead-up to the 2024 election.
